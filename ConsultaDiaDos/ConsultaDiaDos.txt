What is the difference between chomp and chop?

Chomp. This removes the newline characters from the end of a string. So it will remove "\n" or "\r\n"
if those characters are at the end. A substring is removed if it is present.

Chop. It removes the final character from the input. This can lead to corrupt data.
    The last character in a string is always removed with chop—even if it is not whitespace.
    chomp() is safer than chop, as it will not remove an ending char unless it is a newline character.

Which are the different variables’ scopes and what are them used for?


Ruby has 5 variable scopes:

1. Local Variables: these are the normal variables, example x = 25, y = gaurish where x and y are local variables.
2. Instance Variables: these are denoted with @ symbol infront of the actual variable name. mainly used with classes,
    so that each instance/object of the class has a different/separate value. example. @employee.name = 'Alex'
3. Class Variables: denoted with @@ symbols in front of variable name. class variable, I think have same value accos
    all instances/object.
4. Global variables: they start with $ symbol and are accessible everywhere. example $LOAD_PATH
5. Constants: Must start with Capital letter but by convention written in ALL_CAPS. although, it is a constant but
    its value its not constant and can be changed(ruby will throw a warning, though). so in the sense, this also acts
    like a variable.
